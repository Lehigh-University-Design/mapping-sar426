        "Descirption": "<p>Artemisia Gentileschi was one of the most important female Italian Baroque painters. She was the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, another Italian Baroque painter, who admired, followed, and was close friends with the leading Italian Baroque painter of the 16th and 17th century, Caravaggio (Britannica-Artemisia Gentileschi). During this art period, Baroque ideas were expressed through exaggerated depictions. In the 17th century, Artemisa gained the reputation of being the most honored female artist (The National Gallery). </p>",

During the trial, Gentileschi was mentally and physically tortured, as she was forced to reveal the truth of her being raped. She also had to give a humiliating gynecological examination. </p>",

        "Description": "<p>The portrait of Mary Magdalene is known to be representing the emotional and physical state of Gentileschi after being raped in 1611. The redness in the eyes and nose represents her pain and crying. The tired posture and the placement of hands show her state of suffering (Mary Magdalene as Melancholy - Google Arts and Culture). This art piece holds various similarities to the works by Caravaggio “with powerful stage lighting to heighten the effects of emotional drama”. It is currently located in Museo Soumaya (Soumaya Museum) in Mexico City (Artsy). </p>",

She used the patriarchal society of the 17th century in her artworks to her stand of being mistreated as a female; whether through her vulnerable self alone with her emotions or representing dominance by showing female power to men. </p>",

Being a close follower of Caravaggio from a young age, her paintings were considered to be the most dramatic use of light and shadow as well as realism just Caravaggio’s (Britannica-Artemisia Gentileschi). Gentileschi fought hard to be known as a successful female artist in the 17th century without the fame and power of her father, Orazio Gentileschi. </p>",

The purposeful light on Mary and the darkness surrounding her, different colors, and texture of the piece is viewed as very unique which catches the attention of the viewers (Sardeli, 2020). </p>",
