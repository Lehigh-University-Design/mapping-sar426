She was the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, another Italian Baroque painter, who admired, followed, and was close friends with the leading Italian Baroque painter of the 16th and 17th century, Caravaggio (Britannica-Artemisia Gentileschi). During this art period, Baroque ideas were expressed through exaggerated depictions. In the 17th century, Artemisa gained the reputation of being the most honored female artist (The National Gallery). <p>",

The redness in the eyes and nose represents her pain and crying. The tired posture and the placement of hands show her state of suffering (Mary Magdalene as Melancholy - Google Arts and Culture). This art piece holds various similarities to the works by Caravaggio “with powerful stage lighting to heighten the effects of emotional drama”.
